#	HARD LINKS	
#	Only link to files
#	Link to contents on the same disk
#	Reference inode/physical locations
#	Moving file will still allow the link to work
#	ln orig_file link_name


#	SOFT LINKS
#	Can link to dirs and files
#	Can reference files/folders across disks or networks
#	If the original file is deleted, the hard link will remain
#	Links don`t follow the reference file if moved
#	ln -s orig_file link_name
#	ls -la shows the links
